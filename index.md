## Overview

### Platform/Content Management System

Taylor University using the content management system called [dotCMS](https://dotcms.com/). The version of dotCMS that we are on is v5.2. If you need to see any documentation of the dotCMS platform, you can find it at https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/table-of-content.

### CSS/JS Frameworks

This site is using Zurb's Foundation 6 and has been installed using NodeJS and Gulp. Please see Foundation 6 [Documentation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) for more details on the framework. (**P.S.** Your machine will need have npm installed globally to use the npm commands in the following section.) Please see the [setup page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/setup.md %}) of how this framework is being used.

### Repository

You will need access to the repository to run compilation of the sass files. Please ask one of the staff developers for access to the repository. The repository contains the following:
- files that have been updated to the dotCMS
- compilation script for sass
- snippets for components used on the website
- templates/layouts
- containers
- widgets

**Please Note**: *All code is worked on outside of dotCMS will need to be uploaded to dotCMS since there is not a good way for dotCMS and Github to integrate at this time.*
