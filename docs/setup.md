### Gulp

We are using gulp to compile are SASS file into CSS. dotCMS does have a SASS compiler but it has proven to be unreliable at times. Also, if the compiler finds an error in the SASS files, it will render a blank css file rather then leave the current compiled css live. This means that the site would load a blank page until the issue is fixed. We are using npm to install Gulp and serve the Foundation 6 sass files. Compiling offline is a safer way so that the process of development continues without possibly break the site. If the dotCMS compiler situation addressed, we will upload the sass files to have dotCMS compile the css and remove the local compiler css for production use.
